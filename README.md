# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data-Project
Programming for Data Science with Python

## Overview
 In this project, Python is used to explore data extracted from bikeshare systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Requirements include:
- Importing data and addressing interesting questions regarding the output results by computing descriptive statistics.
- Creating a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Operation
The developed CLI program allows the user to explore a US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data. The user is also able to choose to view raw data and to sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order.
