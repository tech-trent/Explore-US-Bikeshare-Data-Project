# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data-Project
Programming for Data Science with Python

## Overview
 In this project, the student had to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States — Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The student had to write code to:
- import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics
- write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
